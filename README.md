# Improved Player Control

Improves the user experience when using the change-control cheat (devmode)

- The entire player row is a hitbox for changing control
- Devmode and Sandbox windows are player-colored
- Keybinds for each (ten) players (default ctrl+shift+1..0) and "next player" (default ctrl+shift+,)
